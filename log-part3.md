**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: A teacher who is teaching machine learning online says that machine learning will be the future in some aspects. Well, I have to dig more into his thought. But I believe artifical intelligence will be the future.

### Day 53: Wednesday, November 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: discussed with my classmate and wrote Matlab functions implementing frequency estimation using zero-crossing method. And we get them working after 3 hours. Good job from him. But I don't know his twitter account. ‚ùì

**Thoughts**: A tough day, I don't feel like I can do this coding challenge for 100 days. It's really hard for u to keep doing the same thing without rewarding.
