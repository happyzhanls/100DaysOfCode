# #100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1 - [Linsong Zhan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Wednesday, October 4th, 2017].

### Day 1: Wednesday, October 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review the Resturant analogy and the section 3 - introduction to HTML on my udemy course.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the github.io website. But it's always good to dust off the basic HTML.

### Day 2: Thursday, October 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review another section for more HTML about Table.

**Thoughts:** Just looking at the digimon chart I made kinda reminds me of my happy memories.
