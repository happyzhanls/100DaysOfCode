### Day 1: Wednesday, October 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review the Resturant analogy and the section 3 - introduction to HTML on my udemy course.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the github.io website. But it's always good to dust off the basic HTML.

### Day 4: Saturday, October 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied more about jQuery val(), attr() and so on. Reviewed some basic CSS selectors.

**Thoughts:** Went to the Denver Art Museum with my roomate for a whole day. So I didn't get lots of time to study today. But still I got couple minutes to watch a video about some common jQuery methods during lunch - Text(), HTML(), val() and Attr(), which are pretty useful. Note that what all these methods can do can also be done through DOM methods.

### Day 5: Sunday, October 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed and Studied the concept of The Box Model in CSS by a project called Tic Tac Toe Board.

**Thoughts:** I watched couple league of legends 2017 world championship live matches until late night. It was fun to watch yet bad for my sleeping quality. I ended up with getting up very late and cannot concentrate very well. So definitly it's not a good thing to do. But the Tic Tac Toe board is kinda amazing to make. Also I find there's a better tic tac toe application made by JavaScript online. Just Search: "tic tac toe" via Google and play it!

### Day 6: Monday, October 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: jQuery's on() works similarly to addEventListener(). It's a powerful method that can replace with many others events like click() and keypress().

**Thoughts:** It is snowing in Fort Collins, which is cool. I have been focus on finishing my project proposal for power system. But got some time watching videos about jQuery Event: click, keypress and the most important - on methods. Also one video about jQuery effects: fadeOut, fadeIn, fadeToggle, slideDown, slideUp and slideToggle.

**Today's Progress**: worked more on course project proposal. More on classes in Grid System like "row" and "col-md-3"in the bootstrap components. Also the "jumbotron".

**Thoughts:** I was being stressed out at 5 am in the morning. So all the day my mind is just not there. God damn the project proposal for ECE509. I don't like that course because it's really boring and stupid.
