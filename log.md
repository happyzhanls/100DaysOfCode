The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Wednesday, October 4th, 2017].

### Day 1: Wednesday, October 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review the Resturant analogy and the section 3 - introduction to HTML on my udemy course.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the github.io website. But it's always good to dust off the basic HTML.

### Day 4: Saturday, October 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied more about jQuery val(), attr() and so on. Reviewed some basic CSS selectors.

**Thoughts:** Went to the Denver Art Museum with my roomate for a whole day. So I didn't get lots of time to study today. But still I got couple minutes to watch a video about some common jQuery methods during lunch - Text(), HTML(), val() and Attr(), which are pretty useful. Note that what all these methods can do can also be done through DOM methods.

### Day 5: Sunday, October 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed and Studied the concept of The Box Model in CSS by a project called Tic Tac Toe Board.

**Thoughts:** I watched couple league of legends 2017 world championship live matches until late night. It was fun to watch yet bad for my sleeping quality. I ended up with getting up very late and cannot concentrate very well. So definitly it's not a good thing to do. But the Tic Tac Toe board is kinda amazing to make. Also I find there's a better tic tac toe application made by JavaScript online. Just Search: "tic tac toe" via Google and play it!
