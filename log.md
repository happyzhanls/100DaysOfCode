# #100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1 - [Linsong Zhan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Wednesday, October 4th, 2017].

### Day 1: Wednesday, October 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Review the Resturant analogy and the section 3 - introduction to HTML on my udemy course.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the github.io website. But it's always good to dust off the basic HTML.

### Day 4: Saturday, October 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied more about jQuery val(), attr() and so on. Reviewed some basic CSS selectors.

**Thoughts:** Went to the Denver Art Museum with my roomate for a whole day. So I didn't get lots of time to study today. But still I got couple minutes to watch a video about some common jQuery methods during lunch - Text(), HTML(), val() and Attr(), which are pretty useful. Note that what all these methods can do can also be done through DOM methods.
